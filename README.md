Quote Generator
This is a simple React web application that generates random quotes using an array of quotes as the data source. The user can click a button to get a new random quote, and can also click a button to tweet the current quote.

Technologies Used
React
React DOM
Font Awesome
react-icons
Formik
Bootstrap
react-bootstrap
styled-components
GitHub
gh-pages

Learning Outcome
In this project, I demonstrated proficiency in working with React hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycle methods respectively. I implemented the use of an external data source, specifically the QUOTES array, to dynamically display random quotes and authors. Additionally, I applied CSS styling and utilized external libraries like font-awesome to enhance the visual appeal of the application. By using event listeners and DOM manipulation, I was able to create interactivity and user engagement. Furthermore, I developed a deeper understanding of React components and modularization by breaking down the application into smaller reusable pieces, specifically the QuoteGenerator component. Overall, this project helped me improve my React skills and gain a better understanding of front-end development concepts.

Deployment
This app is deployed using GitHub Pages.

Usage
To use the app, simply open the deployed website and click the "New Quote" button to generate a new random quote. You can also click the "Tweet" button to share the current quote on Twitter.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
